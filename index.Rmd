## Introduction

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


## Creating a Map with the location of University of West Georgia labeled with its icon


```{r MapUWG, echo=TRUE}
library(leaflet)
UWGIcon <- makeIcon(iconUrl = "http://media.bizj.us/view/img/2504431/university-of-west-georgia-logo*750xx731-411-0-126.jpg", iconWidth = 731/20, iconHeight = 411/20)
uwg_map <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(icon = UWGIcon, lat = 33.5735, lng = -85.1028)
uwg_map
```

## Mapping the cities in West Georgia and their populations. 
```{r MapWestGA, echo=TRUE}
WestGA_cities <- data.frame(name = c("Bowdon", "Carrollton", "Mount Zion", "Roopville", "Temple", "Villa Rica", "Whitesburg"),
                            pop = c(2040, 26562, 1696, 218, 4228, 13956, 596),
                            lat = c(33.5379, 33.5801, 33.6343, 33.4565, 33.7371, 33.7321, 33.4940),
                            lng = c(-85.2533, -85.0766, -85.1872, -85.1308, -85.0324, -84.9191, -84.9138))
WestGA_cities %>%
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addCircles(weight = 1, radius = sqrt(WestGA_cities$pop)*30)
```
